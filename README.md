# Cherry Design System
## Introduction
The **Cherry Design System** is a versatile foundation for your projects. As a starting point, it provides a clean slate—a white label—upon which you can build and extend. Whether you’re creating a web application, mobile app, or any other digital interface, Cherry defines the essential components you need.

## Key Features
- **White Label Base**: Cherry serves as a neutral canvas, allowing you to customize and brand it according to your project’s requirements.
- **React Components**: We’ve carefully curated the fundamental building blocks for a typical interface. These include components, typography, color schemes, and layout guidelines.
- **Theming Support**: Cherry embraces theming, enabling you to adapt the design system to different contexts while maintaining consistency.
Sanity and Consistency: By adhering to Cherry’s guidelines, you’ll create a cohesive user experience across various screens and interactions.
- **Open Source**: Cherry takes it a step further by providing ready-to-use source code for the **Figma designs**. This means you not only get the visual templates but also the actual implementation. It’s like having a bridge between your design tool and your codebase.

# Design

## Unleashing Creativity with Cherry

At Cherry, we believe in empowering designers and developers to create exceptional user experiences. Our design system focuses on the essential building blocks—those crucial elements that form the backbone of any interface. While it may seem extensive, rest assured that these elements play a pivotal role during the development phase.

### The Crucial Elements

1. **States and Interactions**: Cherry defines states like hover, focus, and active. These are the subtle yet impactful transitions that enhance user engagement. We’ve got you covered.
2. **Freedom to Create**: Creativity knows no bounds. Unlike rigid systems, Cherry doesn’t impose unnecessary rules. The canvas is yours—design interfaces that inspire and delight.

### The Figma Community Template

Where do you begin? Start with our Figma community template. It’s the launchpad for your design journey. Here’s what it offers:

1. **Figma Variables**: Store color tokens, grid gap sizes, max width values, media queries, padding, and radius values. These variables keep your design consistent and adaptable.
2. **Typography and Shadows**: Text styles and effect styles are your allies. They house typography rules and shadow elevations, ensuring a harmonious visual language.
